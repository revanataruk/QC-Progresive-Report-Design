## 🔄 Shift Workflow System

### 🌅 Shift 1 (Morning: 07:00-15:00)
- **Initialize**: Start new daily production report
- **Data Entry**: Input initial storage and ballmill production data
- **Handover**: Generate PDF for seamless transfer to next shift

### 🌤️ Shift 2 (Afternoon: 15:00-23:00)
- **Option A**: Upload PDF from Shift 1 to continue progressive data entry
- **Option B**: Initialize new report if production begins from this shift
- **Output**: Generate combined PDF (Shift 1 + 2) or standalone report

### 🌙 Shift 3 (Night: 23:00-07:00)
- **Option A**: Upload PDF from previous shift for data continuation
- **Option B**: Initialize new report if production begins from this shift
- **Finalize**: Generate comprehensive PDF for complete production day

## 🔒 Security Framework

### Verification Code System:
- **Unique Shift Codes**: Each shift maintains confidential verification codes
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized data manipulation between shifts
- **PDF Generation**: Required verification before report generation

### Production Code Format:
- **Structure**: `day-date-year-shift-shift_name` (e.g., `010151A`)
- **Date Validation**: Ensures data input matches current production day
- **Continuity Control**: Maintains daily production sequence integrity
